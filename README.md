### Project Description
TechTrek is a career path recommending website specifically made for engineering students or students studying in CS Stream to find out their ideal career.It includes their job interests, it's scope and many other details related to their job.

### The Problem statement
Many students may have chosen the engineering ,B.E or B.Tech mainly because of the ongoing trends or due to parents compulsion on joining it. So students like us literally have no idea on how their future would be which might lead them to stay unemployed or to choose a career which doesn't do justice too what they learned for years.

### The Solution
So our website, TechTrek is just a simple site that includes a questionnaire on what your branch is , your cgpa ,
